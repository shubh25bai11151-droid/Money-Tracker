WHAT THE PROJECT DOES?
This project is a Personal Expense Tracker, a digital tool designed to meticulously record and monitor user expenditures. It functions as a personal financial ledger, allowing users to log every transaction with relevant details, thereby providing a clear and organized view of their spending habits.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL?
The application addresses the common challenge of financial management by enabling users to track where their money is going. By maintaining a detailed record of expenses—including the date, item description, and cost—users can gain critical insights into their spending patterns. This is particularly beneficial for:

College Students: Who often operate on a fixed budget and need to ensure their funds last through the semester.

Young Professionals: Individuals newly responsible for managing their own finances can avoid overspending and build better financial habits.

The tracker helps prevent financial shortfalls by promoting awareness and disciplined spending, ensuring users do not exhaust their resources prematurely.
