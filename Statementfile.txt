Problem Statement-

Many individuals and students struggle to maintain financial awareness and budget discipline because they lack a simple, accessible way to record, review, and calculate their daily and monthly expenditures. The inability to easily track where money is being spent can lead to unexpected shortages, overspending, and difficulty in achieving financial goals. The problem is the need for a basic, reliable, and straightforward digital tool to manage and summarize personal expenses.

Scope of the Project-

The scope of this initial Expense Tracker project is to provide a command-line interface (CLI) application capable of performing fundamental expense management operations.

1. In Scope:
⦁	Recording Expenses: Capturing and storing expense details, including the date, a description, and the monetary amount.
⦁	Viewing Expenses: Displaying a numbered list of all recorded expenses.
⦁	Removing Expenses: Deleting a specific expense entry based on its index (number).
⦁	Calculating Totals: Summing up all recorded expense amounts to provide a total expenditure.
⦁	User Interface: A simple, interactive command-line menu for navigation.
2. Out of Scope (For the Current Version):

⦁	Data Persistence: Saving/loading expenses to/from a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) so they persist after the program closes.
⦁	Categorization: Grouping expenses (e.g., Food, Transport, Study).
⦁	Filtering/Searching: Searching expenses by date, description, or amount.
⦁	GUI/Web Interface: Any graphical or web-based interface.
